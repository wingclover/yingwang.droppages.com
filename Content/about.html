		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>I've always wanted to be an artist. I enjoyed playing music, painting and doing crafts when I was little. I paint with oil pastels and watercolor. I will upload some of my works here later. I might be skillful and handy, but when it comes to doing business and feeding myself with it, I'm very bad about it. </p>

		<p>Recently I found that coding is actually a form of art, just in a logical shell. I'm taking online classes on python, algorithms, database and web framework. Hopefully I will land a job with these skills soon. I’m a fast learner. I’m very comfortable programming with Python and would like to become a full stack developer in the future.</p>
		
		<p>I'm self-disciplined, reliable, and have sharp eyes. As a hobby, I couldn't help pointing out and correcting any typos, grammar errors, etc., in a book, on TV, or outdoor advertisement board. Thanks to years of biological training, I stick to the rules and I'm good at finding and solving problems.</p>
		
		<p>I have a cat. Her name is Tinker Belle. I'm thinking to build a website for her, too. She is an orange tabby, 3 years old. She can do tricks. Twice a day, she has to shake left hand, right hand, and high-five with left hand then right hand to get food. She is also potty-trained, so no litter needed in the house.(We did need some this winter for the frozen driveway.) She knows how to push the doors open, and open them as long as they are not fully closed.</p>
